# What do I want to learn or understand better?
The course is coming to an end and it has certainly been an an informative experience.
This is not only the first time that I've worked on a full-stack project, but also the
first time working in such a large group. Something that I wanted to learn was how to 
implement authorization, but that will have to wait until the next side-project. 

# How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week was the last sprint so there's no more time left to help each other in this course.
But I do believe that everyone in the group have learnt new tools that they will continue
to use in the future such as Git.

# What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Since our sprint from last week was extended to a 2-week-sprint we didn't create any new 
user stories. The only scrum-related stuff done this week was the team reflection and
PO meeting which I participated in.

# What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Integrating Facebook Graph API and making sure that everything works when we merged 
everything into the main branch.
