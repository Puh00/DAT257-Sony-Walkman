# What do I want to learn or understand better?
As we have decided on the "software stack" for our project, I want to become familiar with these
technologies such as React and Spring Boot which will serve as our front-end and back-end. 
One approach of learning the aforementioned frameworks could be done through a mini-project during
the easter break.

# How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By sharing what I have learnt from the mini-project.

# What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
By participating in the Minetest exercise. 

# What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We as a team decided to split up this week's task so we could work more efficiently, so I 
mainly contributed to the mockup as I had previous experience with the software Figma.
