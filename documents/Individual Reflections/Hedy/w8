What do I want to learn or understand better?
this week was the final week of working on the project. I think I understand the backend better, but still not completely. If the project had continued I would have liked to understand it even better, most likely by continuing to work on the backend. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I think I did more learning than “teaching” this week, but tried to work as I have done the previous weeks. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
since the sprint lasted two weeks we didn’t have to define any new tasks, but I reminded my groupmember of checking the scrumboard every whenever we needed to update something. Since this was the last week and we have already finished our mvp my focus have been a bit more on the other course. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I feel that this week I mostly supervised the other member, trying to come up with suggestions for solutions and helping check errors.
our backend group managed to finish what we had set out to do last week. I think we chose an appropriate amount of work to do, especially since I had a lot to do this week in the other course.
