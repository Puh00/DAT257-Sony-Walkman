# what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week we have concluded that the MVP is mostly done. As long as the PO
confirms it, then we can get started with the next iteration. For the backend
part we will probably be focusing on the Spring Security and implement an
authentication system. Now this is something new to me again, so I will spend
some time learning and trying that out.

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Last week has been working great and we proceeded to do the same pair-programming
strategy this week. We have been coding together using a collaborative coding
extension in VSCode and rotating around the host to make sure both me and Ludvig
gets the most out of it. This is working great and I believe we will continue
with the same procedure next week.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Me and Ludvig tried to estimate this week's user story/task (to be able to send
an email in theb backend). Initially we estimated it as a large task since we
didn't know jack about how to send emails using spring and the research naturally
takes a long time. But when we actually tried it, we finished it in one day on
the Wednesday. After that we are left with nothing to do. We did not have a
backup user story either which we really should've had. For future sprints, I 
believe it is essential to carefully estimate the user stories and tasks. If we
are ever unsure of how long a task will take due to lack of knowledge then we
should at least prepare a backup in case of "premature" completion. 
  
# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We managed to finish the user story that requires the backend to be able to send
an invoice through email. This marks the completion of the MVP according to the 
specifications from the PO. Assuming the PO accepts it then we will be moving
on to the next iteration. Of course, we will try to implement whatever the PO
wants. It could be fine-tuning of some current features or a new feature such as
login, security etc.
