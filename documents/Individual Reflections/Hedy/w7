What do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I got to work on the backend and see how it works somewhat. I still don’t understand it very well, but we have still made progress. Next week I will continue working on the backend, (we decided that the sprint should be 1.5 weeks since there were red days this week) and I hope to learn more about how it works then. Like I have written before, I will ask questions when there is something concrete that I don’t understand, but I also think that by continuing working with this part of the project I will learn / pick up things along the way as well. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
See previous weeks answers? But also, I think for next week me and the other member of the group working with the backend should continue to try to figure out things by ourselves as much as possible, in order to learn as much as possible. Though when we do get stuck we also shouldn’t be afraid to ask the other members for help. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Since I didn’t know how the backend worked it was difficult to help create tasks for the sprint. I tried to keep track of when we finished our tasks throughout the week though. I don’t know yet if we will define any new tasks for next week, but if we do I might be able to help more in defining the tasks. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I think my group worked pretty well this week, also pretty efficiently considering we were both somewhat confused at times. Continued with pair programming, we have tried to update the database in order to fit the needs better. Next week we will hopefully manage to connect the social media API things and finish what we started.
