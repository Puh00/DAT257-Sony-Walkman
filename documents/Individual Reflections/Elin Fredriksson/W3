Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
 This week Ludvig, Stina and I worked with the GUI in Figma. I learn some new things about developing a prototype and
 changing it after getting feedback from the PO. The coming sprints I would like to learn more about developing the
 front-end in React by implementing the prototype.

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 Hopefully when I learn more about Figma, I can help others in the team with that knowledge. This week we also had a lot
 of discussions about how to work as a team, how to conduct the meeting etc and I think that I can help the group move
 forward by applying things I have learnt in previous team projects.

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
 This week I was the Scrum master. I think, in the beginning of the sprint at least, that it was a bit unclear how the
 sprint should be structured. But I did my best and hopefully the team now have more knowledge about how a sprint works
 and what responsibilities you have as a Scrum master, at least I do.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
 I worked in the GUI team and developed the prototype further. In detail we worked on the "create invoice" page and made
 sure the prototype had all the features that the PO asked for. The coming sprints I would like to be more familiar with
 the things the other teams are working on to get a better understanding of the project as a whole.
