Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to get better at solving errors and merge conflicts. This week I got to review code a couple of times for pull
requests. I want to get better at peer reviewing code. I'm going to accomplish that by reviewing more carefully and
making sure I understand all the code that I read. Also by asking the other team members if there's something I don't
understand.

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
This week Stina, Hedy and I worked with refactoring things in the front end. I think we learnt a lot by doing everything
together with Code With Me and solving errors as a team. I think I contributed with the CSS styling that I learnt last week.

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I participated in every session and contributed to my team finishing all this weeks tasks. I also helped with defining
tasks in the scrum board to make sure that our team knew exactly what needed to be done.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We worked on small changes in the front end that the PO pointed out in this weeks meeting. For example some information
that were missing in the invoice PDF. We also worked on the styling and made sure that all the components were placed in
the right place according to the prototype.
