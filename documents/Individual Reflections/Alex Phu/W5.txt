# What do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I switched to the frontend team and was introduced to their codebase.
We had quite a difficult time this week with ReactJS. Especially concerning the
process of passing data to child components. So I would like to become more
familiar with ReactJS so we don't have to spend unnecessary time on these
supposedly basic things.

A good lesson learnt this week after spending 5 hours trying to get a library to work:
    => RTFM

# How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I could try to learn as much as possible about the libraries that we are going
to use and then share this knowledge with the other team members if they need
further explanation. 

# What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Last week we discussed how unstructured our meetings were so I was assigned to 
create a meeting agenda for the sprint planning this week. I felt that it
improved the overall efficiency of the meetings since we had established a set of 
topics at the start and thus had a clear outline of the meeting. 
I was the scrum master this week and I assume that this is one of the tasks that 
a scrum master should do: facilitate sprint planning meetings.

# What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Making it possible to see all invoices and see an detailed view of an invoice (as a pdf).
