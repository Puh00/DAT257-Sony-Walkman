# What do I want to learn or understand better?
This is the first time that I've worked on a team with so many members. So one goal could be 
to learn how to cooperate effectively in such team. 

# How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By introducing and explaining how some technologies work which might benefit our project.

An example could be that we from the IT programme could hold a Git workshop as everyone is not familiar
with version control.

# What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Nothing as we have yet to start with Scrum.

# What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
By taking part in the discussion when we constructed the Social Contract.
