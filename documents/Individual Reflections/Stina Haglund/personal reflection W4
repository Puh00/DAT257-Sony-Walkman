(Ski trip this week and have not been super active. Will try to compensate during the coming weeks)

Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
The way the Scrum framework works and how it is applied in the best way possible. Now, I'm starting to get an idea of how it is supposed to work but I notice that we don't always make things "by the book". It would be interesting if one of the members in the group could take a greater responsibility for actually leading the team and be a well informed scrum master.

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
To read more about the Scrum framework and apply it by structure up the meetings and really make sure everyone knows what they are about to do and make everyone feel comfortable. I think the group could really benefit from me (or someone else) being that person. Right now I feel very insecure regarding the actual coding and feel like it will be difficult to contribute with any learning of others there.

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I try to follow the rules we set up and the social contract. I also try to apply the scrum framework in all my work, but of course sometimes I fail/forget. The meetings could be better/ more effective though, and I will try to contribute to making that happen.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Keep a good plan and make sure we dont forget things during meetings and contact  with PO.
