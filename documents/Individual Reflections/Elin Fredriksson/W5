Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I joined the front-end team and started to work more with React. In the beginning of the course I watched a
tutorial on how to use it but apart from that I didn't have much experience. I think I learnt a lot this week. Both
from Gabriel showing me the work he and Hedy did before and by trial and error and some googling. I spent most time
styling the components with CSS and trying to make the website look like the prototype. Next week I want to get even
better at creating and using components and also learn more about CSS styling. I'm going to accomplish that by
researching more and by studying components that exist already.

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
After this week I think I can help my team to learn more about how to style components with CSS.

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
After assigning task from this weeks user stories to the smaller teams. Gabriel and I made detailed checklist of all the
components that should be included before the task should be considered done. That helped to know exactly what needed
to be done. Ahead I want to get better at dividing user stories into tasks. I think I will accomplish that by learning
more about each part of the development process. When I know more about how both the front-end and back-end works it
will probably be easier to see what needs to be done in each user story.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I created the navigation bar at the top of the page. Both the js component and the CSS styling. I also worked
on including the logo and a dot that indicates which page you're currently on. I changed the styling of the whole page
to match the prototype and started on a new set of buttons for the home page.
