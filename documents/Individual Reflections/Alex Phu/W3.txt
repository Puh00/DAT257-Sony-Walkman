# What do I want to learn or understand better?
Although I worked a bit with Spring Boot last week, I still want to dig deeper into this framework so that I can prepare myself 
for future user stories which may require better knowledge of the framework. I.e login functionality (spring security) and 
sending emails from the back-end.

# How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I experimented a bit with Spring Boot during the easter so I'm doing my best to share the knowledge that I've gathered. 

# What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
At the beginning of the week I assisted - along with the other team members - with breaking down the user stories into tasks.

# What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As I was given the responsibility of the back-end, I primarily worked on setting up the initial version of the back-end with Yenan.
