Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about working with Scrum. I think I got a better understanding by participating in the exercise this
Monday.

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By being involved in all parts of the groups work and sharing my experience and reflections along the way.

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
That I participated the best I could in the Minetest exercise. I think both me and the group learnt a lot about how it's
important to have a dialog with the PO about requirements and expectations before starting to work on a task/user story.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I contributed mostly to our groups Business Model Canvas.
