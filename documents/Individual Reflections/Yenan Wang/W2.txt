# what do I want to learn or understand better?
for the most parts, it's still the frameworks that i want to be learn, it's 
decided to use ReactJS and Java with SpringBoot to create this webapp, both
frameworks are new to me so i will use the "self study" period to practice them

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
since the team has decided to learn these frameworks during the eastern, i can
share good resources i've found online to the team

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
not much so far as we haven't talked about how to use the actual scrumboard,
we did talk about the product log which we received directly from our stakeholder,
so i'll try to understand them better and see how much those user stories can
be broken down
  
# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
by participating in the making of the basic mockup according to the project scope
