Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about how to peer review someone elses code. I got one request this week 
and some of the team members showed me how to do. To be comfortable with wth what I'm doing and
learn to review, I'm going to ask that more review are sent to me to be able to practise.

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The efficiency of meetings and my ability to avert discussions that won't lead anywhere is
one thing that I really think can help the group and teach others. Also, my questions regarding
coding to these who are more familiar with it than I am, can help them practice explain things 
and get a "cofirmation" that they understood a certain thing. I'm thinking of the principle 
of "you donät know something until you can teach somebody else".

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I like the Scrum way of working and I really think that my ability to encourage discussion
in different topics helps others to feel free to speak as well.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I am really trying to stay to deadlines and always show uo in time to meetings and try to contribute
as much as I can. I would say I'm more active and driving in the planning meetings, reflections, and PO-meetings
than in the actual coding sessions, and that is because I feel a little bit insecure when it comes to coding. However,
I really try to compensate for that by being active and alert on all other meetings and by doing other "administrative tasks",
which help the group as a whole to deliver on time.
