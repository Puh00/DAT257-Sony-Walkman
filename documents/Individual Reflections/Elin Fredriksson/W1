Q1: I want to learn more about the way of working together on a project with Git and Github
    and also the APIs we're going to use working on the project. I feel like my experience is
    basic when it comes to this but also that I can learn a lot from the other members of the group.

Q2: This far I've learnt a lot from the other students in the group. They walked us through and helped set up
    Git and Github today.

Q3: We haven't really started working with Scrum yet.

Q4: I have Covid right now and haven't really been able to participate as much as I would have wanted.
    Hopefully my fever is lower next week so I can contribute better to the team deliveries.
