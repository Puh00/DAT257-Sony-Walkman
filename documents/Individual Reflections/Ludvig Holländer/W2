Q1: At the moment, i feel like my programming skills are lackluster compared
to the rest of the group. In the future, it would be suitable to learn more programming thats
useful to the project. To do this, i will watch several tutorials on youtube.

Q2: Right now, i can't help the team with programming. I can however, help the team with economics
and try and help explain the business model of our external contact. This is something i have more knowledge on.
I believe that this should be the situation anyways, i think it's better for me to teach the team what im best at
and the rest of the team can teach me what theyre best at. To reach this, we will need to have continuous communication to
get a grip of what we know, and what we dont know that we should know.

Q3: In the minetest excercise, i tried to slow the team down in discussions and try and plan out our apporach to the problems.
This was also done by other members of the team, which was good pracitce for all of us. In the future, we should all try to print the
scrum mindset into our minds and work together to use the framework as efficiently as possible. To get there, we just need more practice
i believe.

Q4: I've contributed the most in the business model and the description of our project. We decided to split up our team so that half of us
did these deliveries and half did the prototype of the product. In the future, i would like to play a part in the design and development
of the product, since i belive that would be a very interactive and fun experience. To do this, i will have to, as stated above, learn more programming
so that i can actually contribute with more than just inputs and comments.
