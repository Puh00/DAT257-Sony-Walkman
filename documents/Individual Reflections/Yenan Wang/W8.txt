# what do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week I mentioned I should be reading up about Spring Security, but that's
irrelevant now that we have changed up the teams. This final spring I'm finally
going to be working in the frontend and try to integrate Google/Facebook API.
So this week and next week's focus will be just about that.

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Since I've mainly worked with the backend I can always offer my help to the
current backend team whenever they encounter a "legacy code" problem. Otherwise,
I'm the one desperately in need of help in the frontend.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
There were some tasks written but I believe they are to be replaced/updated
next week since we didn't really know how exactly were we going to implement
the external APIs. At least this sprint has been extended until next week, since
there are only 3 working days this week. So things should be sailing smoothly
by then.
  
# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Me and Alex are working on the API integration. Things are not going as well as
we had thought initially. Mainly due to our lack of understanding of their APIs.
So by the end of the week, we had only managed to finish the connection to the
Instagram Basic Display API. But the experience will surely help with the other
APIs. So despite the struggle this week, next week we should be able to finish
the API integration.
