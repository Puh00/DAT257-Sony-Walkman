# what do I want to learn or understand better?
As of the beginning of this week I was assigned the role with a focus on the
backend. While I've read a bit on the documentations and some tutorials of
the SpringBoot API, I still feel a lack of understanding on the subject. So to
improve that I need to be more experienced with it and therefor I plan to
experiment the SpringBoot during my free time.

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Mostly by helping them through voice chat and a shared screen if someone needs
help with anything.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I helped the team by breaking down the user story that we are focusing on to
tasks that revolve around backend.
  
# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
For this week the backend team (me and Alex) has finished creating the database
and we have started working the logic part of the backend. Next week we should 
be able to finish a basic functional backend.
