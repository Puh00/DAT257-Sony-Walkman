Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
First, i want to understand the Scrum framework and I think the best way of doing that i to first read about it and then start use it in practice. Second, I want to learn more about React and understand how it works. That work will be started during next week with a youtube-video and a step-by-step tutorial.

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
To explain the things that the I students have worked with before (e.g. the business model canvas) and to contribute in the meetings by beeing active and make sure everyone is on board with whats happening.

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I still haven't quite figured out how the Scrum framework works in practise. It gets clearer for every day, but I still need to read more about it to get a deeper understanding. I'm interested in the topic och different ways of getting a team working in a way that's friction free as possible, so my contribution will mainly be that I'm interested and really want to understand the different concepts.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I like to structure up meetings and make everyone feel they get their voice heard, and that can be a helpful thing to make sure the deliveries works as smooth as possible. I feel a little insecure about the actual coding, but I'm sure the people who knows it better than what I do will be pedagogic and help me in a good way.
