Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn more about React and how everything works when building a website.
I feel like all the team members are really helpful and tries to teach each other
and make everyone understand. To do pair programming this week has been a good way
to learn more at the same time as the project continues to move forward. I want to
continue with this type of work during next week as well to get an even better understanding
of what is happening

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I really think that my ideas regarding how to structure the actual team, the meetings, and
the progress for the project is really helpful. I always strive to be as efficient as possible
and that helps the team not getting stuck in endless conversations about unimportant things.

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A little bit like my answer in Q2, I think I'm a quite good organizer to make the team feel like
we're on the right track and that everyone feels like they know what they're supposed to focus on.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
The communication, both with the PO, the TA, and within the group. I have also pushed for us,
almost since the start of the course, to delimit the scope of what we promise to deliver.
I really think that this downscaling of the project has been good for the group in terms of
knowing where the focus lies, but also to actually be able to communicate with the PO in
a way so that both parties understand each other. Lastly, the downscaling helps us being able to
focus on the application of the Scrum framework simultaneously as providing a product of value to
the PO.
