Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
Since the project is finished, I feel like I'm pretty satisfied with what I leanred by now. I really enjoyed 
the Scrum way of working within a team, and of course, my skills within this framework could improve a lot.

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The project is over so there is no more time to teach each others within the group, but I am going to present 
our work next week, which maybe could give some of the team members takeaways on how to present for an audiance 
and what mistakes that could be avoided.

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I have tried to stick to the Scrum framework in everything I do, and without everyone doing that the process 
gets messy and unstructured.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My sub team really tried to finish early by the week since some of the others work were dependent on us finishing 
our thing for them to start.
