Q1: what do I want to learn or understand better?
This sprint, we are creating a page very similar to a page that already exists, which will give me
the opportunity to really understand more of the code, which is something I really want to learn.

Q2: how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Like previous weeks, I think I'm a good person to ask relevant questions, which gives the person explaning
a confidence that he/she really understood things right. Further, I am (from what I know) the only person
in the group who actually read a little bit about the Scrum framework in the recommended litterature. This reading 
provided me with knowledge which can sometimes help in discussions and doubts.

Q3: what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I like the Scrum way of working and I really think that my ability to encourage discussion
in different topics helps others to feel free to speak as well. Moreover, the reading i did that I also mentioned in
Q2 also helps in the understanding of Scrum.

Q4: what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week, my sub team decided to postpone much of the work til next week since we prolonged this sprint from 1 to 1,5
weeks, and the group members had a lot of other things to deal with in other courses. However, I attended all the meetings
and tried to understand what the other have done. Of course, I will make sure to be finished with my things when the sprint ends.
