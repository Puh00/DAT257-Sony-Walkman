Spent most of the time researching on how to interact with "Instagram Basic
Display API" which we actually managed to do. But then we realized that we 
couldn't fetch some data such as amount of likes and views on a post from 
that API. So we'll have to start over next week and research about the other
API called "Instagram Graph API", which should contain those stuff.
