# what do I want to learn or understand better?
I have been content with the pace we are progressing. The overrall efficiency
has been really good for a team consisting solely of inexperienced programmers.
If there is anything I would like to learn, then it would probably be an
alternative way of working collaborately in a team.

During this course we have been doing exclusively pair/trio-programming.
Admittedly, this is the best way to produce high-quality codes while also
learning a whole bunch. I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of the
merits of pair-programming now, and I can't help but wondering about how a team
executes when everyone is working solo. Though, this will have to be
investigated later, in some future projects, maybe.

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
God knows.

On a more serious note, there is nothing more we "need" to do on the technical
side. Only thing left now are the presentation and the final reflection.
Therefore, no one really need to learn anything new for this project. What I
could do though, is to revise what we have done so far so that the final
reflection can go more smoothly.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Not neccessarily a whole lot this week since the tasks have already been defined
lask week. We did, however, update some of the tasks to match our current
situations. The modifications happened mainly due to the lack of knowledge of
the technical aspects of our last user story. If we had any idea about what is
to be expected when it comes to API integration, then we probably could foresee
the problems we might encounter, and therefor make more appropriate tasks.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Last week me and Alex were trying to implement the Instagram API, but it turned
out that the instagram offers two different sort of APIs for the two different
types of users they have (Yeah, we kinda realized that way too late), evidently 
normal users and business users. We thought that would be too much work so we
called it quits and switched to Facebook API.

So this week, me and Alex managed to integrate the Facebook API into our
application and that marks the final step of this project. It was not the most
we could have done but considering the amount of research that required us to 
do, I would say that is fair.
