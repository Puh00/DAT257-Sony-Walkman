# what do I want to learn or understand better?
The pair-programming sessions were pretty useful since I was taught a lot of
springboot and am now feeling rather confident to tackle this on my own (thanks Alex).
The next step would probably be the frontend but that depends on next week's
role assigments. So as for now I will just keep on learning the backend so that
I may help someone else with the spring.

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As usual through a shared screen and a voice chat to learn/fix something
together. If I stay in backend team after next week's role assigment then I
will also be able to help out my other teammates to learn about spring.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
I wrote some tasks and the subtasks needed in order to complete those tasks.
Those tasks are of course, related to the backend aspect of the user story
since that is my assigned role. There were some obscurities in terms of what
exactly the PO wanted and as a result there were also a lot modifications made
to the tasks that are already defined. If we had a better understanding of what
we needed to do then the situation would have been alleviated. In order to
achieve that we need to focus on the MVP as well as to push the POs to be more
specific of what they wanted.
  
# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Me and Alex managed to finish the tasks defined at the start of the week. I am
fairly content with this result and aim to keep or even improve it in the
future sprints. Of course, for that to be possible we need to be reasonable
with our workload and estimate the hours it will take.
