What do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I worked with many small things and as the scrum master. I tried to structure up meetings more and take more initiative. I have been working on the frontend parts the whole time and think it would be nice to learn more about the backend parts. Though that will probably take a lot of time to catch up to where the backend team is now, so I am unsure if it’s realistic or not. I asked for help when I needed it. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
honestly, pretty much the same things as last week. 

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
As scrum master this week I tried to keep better track of things, but I think more practice is needed. I didn’t notice that the two frontend teams were doing similar things, (luckily no repeated work), but for next week we will try defining tasks a bit differently in order to not let this happen again.  

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My team worked on trying to fix some left over things and kind of clean up the design and things like that. We finished what we had planned and even managed to do some more things.
