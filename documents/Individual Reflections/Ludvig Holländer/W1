Q1:
I would like to learn mor about the APIs we're going to use
during the programming sessions. I will probably learn this by our
fellow colleagues who have a bit more experience than me in these sort of excercsies.

Q2:
I can be very attentive while the IT-gang explains something and then maybe explain to someone
that didn't understand yet. I could also provide some knowledge in project management or something of the sorts.
The educating part shouldnt be a problem for me, i work as a tutor regularly.

Q3:
None yet, but i'm very good at becoming inpatient if nothing gets done in a group meeting so that could contribute to
overall effectiveness in sprints.

Q4: I will be a force of creativity and provide a lot of ideas of how a problem might be solved.
I will also try and follow and understand every new step we make and come with questions and stuff like that.
Right now i really dont know much about the project so we'll see.
